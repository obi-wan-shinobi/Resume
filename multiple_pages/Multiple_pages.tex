\begin{rSection}{POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY}

\begin{rSubsection}{Team Vector}{August 2018 - April 2019}{Developer}{ABU Robocon 2019}
\item Assigned to build and code a quadruped robot and a wheeled robot with dynamic locomotive abilities
\item The project was about an annual competition conducted by Asia Broadcast Union and consisted of a series of tasks that were supposed to be performed abiding the rules of the competition
\item Two robots were created, one being an autonomous quadruped and the other a wheeled robot which had dynamic locomotive abilities
\end{rSubsection}

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSubsection}{Team Vector}{August 2019 - April 2020}{Mentor}{ABU Robocon 2020}
\item Mentored junior members of the team for designing two robots with holonomic drives
\item The project was about a competition which would have the robots play rugby with 5 obstacles in the way
\item Two robots were created out of which one was supposed to have throwing and kicking capabilities and the other was supposed to have catching and placing capabilities. Both robots had dynamic locomotive abilities owing to the holonomic drive design

\begin{rSection}{PROJECTS \& RESEARCH} 

\begin{rSubsection}{\href{https://github.com/obi-wan-shinobi/Galaxy_Zoo}{The Galaxy Zoo Project}}{August 2019 - Present}{}{}
\item A galaxy morphology classification project using deep learning
\item Studied different convolutional neural networks and their architectures
\item Studied different architectural blocks to enhance performance
\item Developed a network for vote fraction predictions of 37 galaxy features from the Galaxy Zoo decision tree
\item Developed a network for classification of galaxies into 7 classes based on their morphologies
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{\href{https://github.com/obi-wan-shinobi/einsteinpy}{The EinsteinPy Project}}{March 2020 - April 2020}{}{}
\item Contributer to an open source community python package for general relativity
\item \textbf{Contributions}:
\item Addition of  Reissner–Nordström metric: a static solution to the Einstein-Maxwell field equations, into the code (\textit{PR: \#462 Issue: \#309})
\item Corrections in the Kerr-Newman and Kerr metrics classes
\item Added calculations of event horizon and ergosphere for a Kerr-Newman blackhole (\textit{PR: \#472 Issue: \#109})
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{\href{https://github.com/obi-wan-shinobi/BTC_predictor}{Time series analysis and prediction}}{March 2019}{}{}
\item Developed a recurrent neural network that analyses time series and predicts future time frame
\item The project took into account a stock price, bitcoin exchange and other time series and could predict almost accurately the trend in prices
\item Another project consisted of using pandemic data of active cases and visualising them as a time series and predicting the epi-curve for COVID-19
\item An introductory project for LSTM networks which are extensively used in audio and sound analysis
