\begin{rSection}{POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY}

\begin{rSubsection}{Team Vector}{August 2018 - April 2019}{Developer}{ABU Robocon 2019}
\item Assigned to build and code a quadruped robot and a wheeled robot with dynamic locomotive abilities
\item The project was about an annual competition conducted by Asia Broadcast Union and consisted of a series of tasks that were supposed to be performed abiding the rules of the competition
\item Two robots were created, one being an autonomous quadruped and the other a wheeled robot which had dynamic locomotive abilities
\end{rSubsection}

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSubsection}{Team Vector}{August 2019 - April 2020}{Mentor}{ABU Robocon 2020}
\item Mentored junior members of the team for designing two robots with holonomic drives
\item The project was about a competition which would have the robots play rugby with 5 obstacles in the way
\item Two robots were created out of which one was supposed to have throwing and kicking capabilities and the other was supposed to have catching and placing capabilities. Both robots had dynamic locomotive abilities owing to the holonomic drive design
